#MMO-Patcher-Style Timer
##What is this?
This is a small and random front-end-oriented project I made for my own personal use. My friends and I like to meet for tabletop gaming every so often. In the time between those meetings, I might be preparing worldbuilding and other materials in the case of doing Game Master preparation. Seeing as I like online games, I felt that the process of expanding the tabletop world and game was similar to the act of patching/maintaining an online MMO/Game as a Service. And so, I made this little silly thing. Feel free to use, repurpose, and integrate it for your own need(s).

##Implementation Details
