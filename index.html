                                The initial release of <i>Theatre of Deities</i>. The group meets at the <b>Cursin' Ursine</b>, introducing one another and
                                stirring up mischief (in various shades of illegal) around the inn and all of <b>Bairgon</b>. Before long, the party intoxicates the workers, along with some children.
                                As they curiously follow the children, they find themselves at a strange "fun park" called <b>Dungeon 01</b> that was shambled together over some old ruins.
                                Enjoying their stay in the park, the party soon begin uncovering strange symbols and inscriptions in the park's ruins. As their suspicions rise, the walls are suddenly blown apart,
                                and cultists donning dark purple cloaks and lion masks take the blacksmith's son, Erwin, deeper into the ruins.

                                The wall crumbles, from it emerged two dark robed cultists. With them, they carry away the blacksmith's son, Erwin.
                                With the goblins granting them their blessings (and some first aid), the party rushes deeper into the ruins in pursuit
                                of the cultists. They enter the <b>Forgotten Undercroft</b>. Within its depths, they face its denizens and solve obscure puzzles,
                                as they tail their quarry. In the deepest chambers, they find the cultists hunched over Erwin with a strange alchemical contraption
                                attached to the child. Within it, a strange red liquid. The party ambushes the pair, and before long, one of the cultists conjure
                                a stygian boar with scarlet eyes and bloody tusks. It unleashes an ashened huff, and the party begins to battle it. In its midst they are 
                                reinforced and aided by the half-orc cleric <b>Jorna</b> and the hulking armoured warrior <b>Helgar</b>, as they take down the boar. The last cultist
                                bolts off, attempting to collapse the tunnel behind them, but Rattington goes after them in hot pursuit.

                                and of the <b>Crimson Conflicts</b>. A strange violet light pulses in the sky from beyond the western horizon.
                                The group huddles in the inn, discussing who each of them are and of their next plans.

                                figure out how to send it. Chaona finally does some laundry. The party splits up. After attempting to rob the inn, Ellie drunkenly heads over to a rumoured
                                'owl forest' with Chaona and Renato in tow. Ezoreal and Rattington try their hands (or paws... claws?) at some grocery shopping in town. After some close calls
                                with a band of goblins, and financial mismanagement, the party reunites and stops some fabric banditry.

                                The party, newly named as the <b>Cancer Crew</b>, head towards <b>Minoco</b>. Along their way, they practice some
                                sneaky herbology, eavesdrop on some rumours, and noisily start their music career. They camp for the night but Chaona wakes up, his pondering unwittingly pulls
                                him into the <b>Misty Owlwood</b>. The party follows, and in pursuit of a strange copper feathered owl, they lose themselves
                                within the wood. The horses run off after a brief misadventure with shrieking mushrooms, and the crew are forced to find
                                the horses as well as a way out. They continue to chase elusive visions of the wood, while being chased themselves. Coming across a wounded creature,
                                the party finds it to be an injured owlbear cub. It runs off, overwhelmed by the group. The crew follows, and they find themselves in a ruined clearing
                                , where they fight to protect the cub from undead and a grey hulking creature with claws, known as a Ghast. After the fight settles and bridges
                                are (literally) burned, they are guided by a mysterious lady within the wood towards a warm log hut, where an elderly woman awaits them.

                                The Cancer Crew meet Meredith, an old lady who lives in the Misty Owlwood with her two grand daughters. The two run off to fetch
                                the party's lost horses, as the crew have breakfast with the misty eyed grandmother. Strange questions are asked, spice preferences are acquired,
                                and horses are found. After their breakfast, the party sets off towards <b>Minoco</b>, in the hopes of finding the missing supply cart and fulfilling Bafir's
                                request. As they briefly pass through the <b>Sunlit Riverland</b> and into the <b>Cleaven Woodland</b>, they meet <b>Rani Otto</b>, a clumsy but
                                lively young apprentice who cautiously interrogates them. They strike a bargain with him through <i>skillful</i> diplomacy, after chasing him through the woods,
                                and he leads the crew to his master, <b>Edi Wagner</b>. They are informed about creatures wandering through the woods in packs, bearing the mark of a wounded white hand. In it is a scarlet wound, shaped almost like an eye. 
                                Furthermore, she mentions the disappearence of the regular supply cart that usually passes the woods from Minoco. The party is then paid by Edi to investigate the strange goings on of the woods, smell the pretty and locally infrequent white dogwood
                                tree, and then enter the deeper layer of the wood. There they find the remains of the cart, and the bodies of a horse and the rider. Confirming that it is indeed the cart they
                                were seeking, the crew turns back towards <b>Edi Wagner's</b> architecturally unsound hut, but are ambushed back at the dogwood tree by shadlings. The tree is accidentally burnt, and
                                a companion is knocked out for the count during the ensuing battle. However, through clever use of magic by Ezoreal, their adversaries are put to sleep, and then slit into an eternal one by Ellie and Chaona.
                                One of the shadlings meets their demise, and shrieks out a distorted and jumbled song. Within it the crew swear they hear their own voices scrambled together. Everyone reconvenes
                                at the hut. The party splits, allowing their companion, Renato to rest safely, while the rest head to Minoco to report their findings. Albert Becker is woken up too early in the morning,
                                but grumpily recognizes the crew's successful completion of the request. As one half of the party are safely guided to an inn, the other half remains at Edi's hut. There, the importance of companionship and self-care are emphasized in a spontaneous therapy session.
